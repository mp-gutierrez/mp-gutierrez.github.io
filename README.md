<h2>Title of the project</h2>
    MP's Portfolio
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
    In this website I've upload a brief description about me and access links to the repositories of some of my projects. This is how I intend to keep track of my progress as a web developer.
<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
    There's no need for installation, however, you can download the website to run it locally. In order to do so, all the files need to be stored into the same folder, keeping each file name and its extension intact. With the files in place, a simple drag-n-drop of the index.html file into a chromium-based browser will load it correctly.
<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
    After properly loading the file, you can browse it as you normally would in a browser, but without the need of an internet connection.

<br>
<h2>Support</h2>
    In case of requiring further assistance, you can contact me via Twitter @mpgutierrz

    <li>Keep the website updated with the projects to come.</li>
    <li>Make some elements more dynamic with JS.</li>
    </ul>
